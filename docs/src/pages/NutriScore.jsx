          A Nutrition Labeling System That Simplifies Choice Eating
        </h2>
        <p className="text-description">
          Nutritional values play an essential role in our understanding of the
          nutritional quality of food products. Nutri-Score, for example, is a
          nutritional labeling system which uses these values to assign an
          overall rating to a product food, thus facilitating consumer
          decision-making. Indeed, the Nutri-Score highlights the nutritional
          value of a produced in a simple and visual way, going from the letter
          A (green) for the healthiest products with the letter E (red) for the
          least healthy. This system helps consumers choose foods more balanced
          and opt for healthier choices, at a glance at the label.

          The Evaluation of Nutritional Values in the Nutri-Score
        </h2>
        <p className="text-description">
          The Nutri-Score takes into account several key nutritional values,
          such as calories, saturated fats, sugars, salt, proteins, fibers, as
          well as the percentages of the daily value (% DV) of these elements.
          By combining this information, the Nutri-Score assesses the overall
          nutritional quality of a food, considering both beneficial nutrients
          and elements to limit. This labeling system has become a valuable tool
          for health-conscious consumers, helping them make more informed
          dietary choices in an environment where nutritional information can
          sometimes be complex to interpret.
